TO INSTALL A SHORTCUT DIRECTORY IN LINUX BASH ON WINDOWS:

~ <- THAT MEANS HOME DIRECTORY


IN THE LINUX BASH HOME DIRECTORY OPEN THE RC FILE WITH THE NANO EDITOR:

john@DESKTOP-50Q7VPH:~$ nano ~/.bashrc

# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files (in the package bash-doc)
# for examples

# If not running interactively, don't do anything
case $- in
    *i*) ;;
      *) return;;
esac



ADD THIS LINE IF YOU WANT A SHORTCUT TO THE WINDOWS HOME DIRECTORY:
alias winhome='cd /mnt/c/Users/john/'




TO SAVE ALTERED RC FILE:
	control-x, y to save, enter to keep the same file name




SAVE THE CHANGES IN .bashrc
john@DESKTOP-50Q7VPH:~$ source ~/.bashrc

NOW winhome WORKS  (NO NEED TO cd, SINCE THAT'S ALREADY IN THE VARIABLE NAME
john@DESKTOP-50Q7VPH:~$ winhome
john@DESKTOP-50Q7VPH:/mnt/c/Users/john$
